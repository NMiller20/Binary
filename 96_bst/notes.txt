DISCO:
Almost all recursive algorithms seem to require a helper function to have the user input the correct number of parameters.
Besides the value inserted first, it often doesn't matter the order in which you insert other values, but it may determine
how degenerate the tree is.

QCC:
Is there a quick and efficient way of handing a bunch of if statements in java?
where are trees useful as data structures that are completely separate from trace diagrams?
Can trees have 'portals'- left or right children which are actually references to the root?
