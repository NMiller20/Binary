Reminders to Self: 
- NumErrorMessages != NumErrors
- LocationOfErrorMessage != LocationOfError
- Remedies suggested by error messages often go beyond the scope of this course and may not work. 

Most Common Errors: 
- You don't have matching: 
	- brackets, parenthesis
	- quotation marks
	- types for the variabe you are creating
- Semicolons!!
- (for methods)
	- Are the arguments in your invocation appropriate?
	- instance vs. static methods
	- The class or the object invoking the method is appropriate
- Don't refer to instance variables in a static method

Debugging by bisection - essentially a binary search for your error

"hanging" - when you hit run and you get no return of anything - the program just keeps going and going
	- if you're not sure which loop is the issue, print stuff at the beginning and the end of the loop and see what gets printed
	- printing stuff in the midle of loops/recursion is esp helpful
	
StackOverflowError is a type of exception

NullPointerException - when the variable in question is null
ArithmeticException - generally division by 0
