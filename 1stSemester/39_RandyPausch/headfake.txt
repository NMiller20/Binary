 HW39 - Randy Pausch Lecture
 2021-11-29
 time spent: 1.3 hrs

 Thoughts: 
 - (while watching) This is essentially the same argument my mom uses about her algebra class! that it teaches critical 
   thinking, rather than just algebra!

 - (after watching the entire lecture) Pausch seems to place a much greater importance on working with the people you have,
   rather than seeking out the environment and the community you believe will best suit you, and in which you will be the 
   most useful. This is completely the opposite of how I tend to do things - is my approach incorrect? 
 - or perhaps I am oversimplifying things to say the above? Implied in most of the things he talks about is a great degree
   of intentionality in what he chooses to pursue, and how and where he pursues it. It might be more accurate to say that 
   different people have different relationships with social opportunity, but mine tends to focus more on the choice of 
   environment side of things. 
 - Interestingly enough, he never explains exactly what about virtual reality he finds so interesting. But I guess this 
   lecture would probably be the wrong place to discuss that? In addition, much of his audience appears to already be 
   interested in virtual reality.
