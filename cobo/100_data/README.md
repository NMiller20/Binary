1.1 Sites I access regularly:
Google; Youtube
1.2
Google and Youtube access data that user gives them, for example their username, name, or possibly their payment info, as 
well as device info, such as your IP address and browswer settings. 
1.3
Delimited - having limits
In the context of CS, delimited means that the start and the end of a piece of data are marked. Starts and ends enable the 
user to process the data. 
1.4 
One possible way of finding out the type of data contained in the column of a file could be to see what kinds of functions 
can be invoked on it. 
1.5 
I am interested in social science and epidemiology. 
1.6 
What factors drive voter turnout?
	-> Is there a correlation between the number of poll sites in Kings county and voter turnout?
Is there a statistically driven way of determining someone's individual risk of depression or anxiety? 
1.7 + 1.8
While I'm having some difficulty finding it, I know that the Board of Elections has a database containing
turnout records, and that by definition, this will only be one record per election. 
Using a larger set - for example, both official voter turnout records and numbers from exit polls - 
wouldn't in this case make a difference, but in general, larger data sets are likely to be more accurate
if the thing they're collecting data on is something for which an indefinitely large amound of data could potentiallly exist - for example, if you are talking about data on teen social media usage, collecting data from the maximum number of teens possiblw would probably give you averages that are closer to the true average social media usage. 
1.9 
Youtube, for example, generally collects data on what videos users click on and matches this with other info they have on users. This allows Youtube to put more popular videos higher in people's search results. While such search algorithms have had a lot of negative impacts on society - the rise of misinformation, and increased polarization, for example - one could say that this overall increases people's access to information they find relevant. 
1.10 
Board of Elections data on voter turnout was collected by counting registrations and ballots. 
1.11
Yes, there are situations in which it is worthwhile to sacrifice privacy for data. For example, having your medical information be used in an epidemiology study might help future medical professionals and policy makers prevent certain health issues. 

2.1 
Cereal type (best names for the data in each rows)
2.2 A question about the above table: 
Is there a relationship between sugar and rating? 
2.3 Class to answer question above:
public class CerealData
2.4 
Based on the table, there will be 14 instance variables for each CerealData
2.5 Instance variables: 
String Type; 
int calories; 
double gProtein
double gFat
double mgSodium
double gFiber
double gCarbs
double gSugar
int mgPotassium
int vitamins
double weight
double cups
double rating

You can determine average rating of several different cereals
2.9 
You can't determine ann








The temperature at Atlanta, Hartsfield - Jackson Atlanta International Airport, GA is 71.0F
3.2: 
The temperature at New York, La Guardia Airport, NY is 50.0F

You could filter alphabetically by code, though it is unlikely to give you any useful informtion
3.6 Pago Pago, American Samoa
3.7 Looking at the number of weather stations in each state, you could figure out the state 
with the most weather stations. 
3.8
This would not involve much more code.
