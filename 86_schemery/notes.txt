Algo:

1. Parse the string:
  If you see an open parenthesis or a number, you add that to the content
  stack.
  If you see an operator, add that to the operator stack.
  When you see a close parenthesis, pause:
2. (use while loop)
Pop the operator
Pop numbers from the content stack, and do operations with them,
  until you pop an open parenthesis instead of a number.
  At this point, add your result to the content stack (as a string)

  Return to parsing the String

  Once you're at the end of the string, check to see if there's anything 
  left in either , besides exactly one number in the content stack.

  If that's the case, pop that number, return it, and exit the function.
  If not, traverse the string another time.



Keep parsing through the string until you reach a close parenthesis.
